4.	aws --version.
5.	aws configure.

-Environmental Variables: This can be accessed using the syntax $VARIABLE name




-Error Handling: this can be achieved by running the command “set -e” or “set -ex” to enable debugging.

The project gave me an insight into the concept of shell script and these five essential skills

In the process of carrying out this project there were places I got stuck but with the help of the team and the internet, I was able to scale through.
